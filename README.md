# Recipe

![Project (1)](https://github.com/sharik-h/Jetpack-compose-recipe-app/assets/83115285/6c74f7f4-3cff-42a8-a1aa-1950eb04a98f)

Introducing the Recipe App, a designed application that allows you to store all your favorite recipes in one convenient location. With this app, you'll have all the details you need to make delicious dishes right at your fingertips. Each recipe includes information on the time and difficulty of preparation, so you can make an informed decision about whether or not to tackle a particular dish. There's even a separate space for saving all the necessary ingredients.

The Recipe App was developed using the Kotlin language and features a sleek Jetpack Compose UI. The app follows the MVVM architecture and utilizes dependency injection and Retrofit for seamless communication with the server. Best of all, all components are reusable, making the code clean and easy to maintain.

But that's not all - the server was created using Ktor and is incredibly user-friendly. With the Recipe App, you'll have everything you need to create mouth-watering meals right at your fingertips.

## What I learned
During the development of this project, I have learned how to perform dependency injection using Dagger Hilt which is very useful in making the project testable, I also familiarized myself with retrofit and learned to use different types of HTTP requests for sending and retrieving data as well as managing how to manage a server when received a request and how to respond accordingly to manage the remote database using mongodb.
